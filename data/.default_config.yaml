# WARNING: please CAREFULLY read the README.md file located in the project's
# root directory BEFORE making changes to this file, and certainly before

###########  PLAYLIST SCAN CONFIGURATION  ##########

PLAYLIST_CONFIG:

  # ----- Delay Between Each Cycle of Playlist Moderation ----- #
  #
  # How long (in seconds) do you want SpotifyAutoModerator to wait before
  # starting a new scan?
  # For example, a frequency of 30 minutes means that SpotifyAutoModerator will
  # wait 30 minutes AFTER COMPLETING
  # a particular scan of all protected playlists before it starts the next scan.
  # During this delay time you will have the ability to quit.
  #
  # Example - 2 minute delay:
  # DELAY_BETWEEN_SCANS: 120

  DELAY_BETWEEN_SCANS: 120


  # ----- Protect All or Selected ----- #
  #
  # Do you want SpotifyAutoModerator to protect ALL of your collaborative
  # playlists?
  # Available options: true, false
  #
  # Example:
  # PROTECT_ALL: false

  PROTECT_ALL: false


  # ----- Global Protection Mode ----- #
  #
  # Determines how authorization of track additions to protected playlists are
  # evaluated at the global level (i.e., if the addition is not explicitly
  # authorized/unauthorized at the local, playlist-level).
  # Available options: blacklist, whitelist
  #
  # Example:
  # GLOBAL_MODE: whitelist

  GLOBAL_MODE: whitelist


  # ----- Global Whitelist of Authorized Users ---- #
  #
  # A list of accounts authorized to contribute to ALL of your protected
  # playlists. For example, you may trust some friends to add tracks to all of
  # your protected playlists.
  #
  # Example:
  # GLOBAL_WHITELIST:
  #   - spotifyusername1
  #   - spotifyusername2

  GLOBAL_WHITELIST:
    - spotifyusername1


  # ----- Global Blacklisting of Unauthorized Users ----- #
  #
  # A list of accounts essentially blocked from contributing to any of your
  # collaborative playlists.
  #
  # Example:
  # GLOBAL_BLACKLIST:
  #   - spotifyusername1
  #   - spotifyusername2

  GLOBAL_BLACKLIST: []


  # ----- Maximum Number of Backups Per Playlist ----- #
  #
  # SpotifyAutoModerator identifies removals of tracks using backups of playlist
  # constituents. What is the maximum number of backups that should be stored
  # for each playlist?
  # This number cannot be less than 1.
  #
  # Example:
  # MAX_BACKUPS_PER_PLAYLIST: 1

  MAX_BACKUPS_PER_PLAYLIST: 1


  # ----- Backup Path ----- #
  #
  # File system path where playlist backups will be stored.
  #
  # Example:
  #  BACKUP_PATH: data/backups

  BACKUP_PATH: data/backups


  # ------ Playlist-specific Protection Settings ------ #
  # List of playlists that should be monitored and a list of authorized accounts
  # for each playlist
  #
  # Example:
  # PROTECTED_PLAYLISTS:
  #   - ProgressiveJazzFusion:
  #       uri: spotify:playlist:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  #       whitelist:
  #         - spotifyusername1,
  #         - spotifyusername2
  #   - ProkofievConcertoMix:
  #       uri: spotify:playlist:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  #       blacklist:
  #         - spotifyusername3
  #         - spotifyusername4

  PROTECTED_PLAYLISTS:
    - MyPlaylistLabel:
        uri: spotify:playlist:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
        whitelist:
          - spotifyusername1


##########  SPOTIFY ACCOUNT CONFIGURATION  ##########

ACCOUNT_CONFIG:

  # ----- API Authorization Information for the Application ------ #
  #
  # API access for a new application can be configured at
  # 'developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications'
  # Your `REDIRECT_URI` will need to be configured for the application once you
  # generate a client ID/secret
  #
  # Example:
  # CLIENT_ID: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  # CLIENT_SECRET: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  # REDIRECT_URI: http://localhost:8080/

  CLIENT_ID: replace_this_with_your_spotify_client_id
  CLIENT_SECRET: replace_this_with_your_spotify_client_secret
  REDIRECT_URI: http://localhost:8080/


  # ----- Spotify Username (Account ID) ----- #
  #
  # WARNING: Spotify display names are often not the same as their corresponding
  # account names/IDs!
  # Find your username on your Spotify profile:
  # 'More' ('...' button) -> 'Share' -> 'Copy Spotify URI'
  # Your username is then the LATTER PART of your Spotify URI (after, and
  # excluding) the second colon
  # For example, if your Spotify URI is 'spotify:user:omnimeta' then your
  # username/ID is 'omnimeta'.
  #
  # Example:
  # USERNAME: spotifyusername

  USERNAME: replace_this_with_your_spotify_username


##########  LOGGING CONFIGURATION  ##########

LOG_CONFIG:

  # ----- File for Storing Log Data ----- #
  #
  # The path identifying the file where log information from runs of
  # SpotifyAutoModerator will be stored
  #
  # Example:
  # FILE: data/logs/debug.log

  FILE: data/logs/debug.log


  # ----- Log Format ----- #
  #
  # The format used for logging.
  #
  # Example:
  #  FORMAT: '%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',

  FORMAT: '%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'


  # ----- Log Levels ----- #
  #
  # The threshold (of severity) for log messages to be displayed on the console
  # or saved to the log file.
  # A lower level results in more information being logged. E.g., no log
  # messages are ignored if at the lowest level ('debug'), but all except the
  # most severe log messages (like those relating to critical errors) are
  # ignored at the highest level ('critical').
  # Available options: 'debug', 'info', 'warning', 'error', 'critical'
  #
  # Example:
  # FILE_LEVEL: debug
  # CONSOLE_LEVEL: info

  FILE_LEVEL: debug
  CONSOLE_LEVEL: info
